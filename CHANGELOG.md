## Version 2.0.1

- A message bar at the bottom of the main window displays the latest message
  for several seconds. An example is a message reporting how many fixes were
  made using Fix All in a checker dialog.
- A toolbar containing common buttons appears next to the message bar. The
  toolbar contains Load, Save, Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Search/Replace,
  Go Back, Go Forward (see below), and Help.
- Go Back and Go Forward have been added to the Search menu. These are similar
  to the back/forward buttons in a browser, going back to previous locations
  in the file. Each time the cursor is moved via a search, or by clicking on 
  a checker message, the current location is saved into the list that is used.
- A regex library has been added. This works in a similar way to scannos, using
  a file of regexes and replacements, but can be used for any replacements,
  not just scannos. One file is supplied, `dashes.json`, which helps with
  conversion of hyphens to more specific dashes. Users may add their own files
  to the library.
- "Search" within Word Frequency has been improved and extended to all checker
  dialogs. Instead of just being able to type a single character, e.g. "G" to
  jump to the first entry in the list beginning with "G", you can now type
  part or all of a word, in a similar way to Windows File Explorer or macOS
  Finder. If several characters are typed with no delay, they are treated as
  a search term. After a delay, the search term is reset. In checker dialogs,
  the default is to search the beginning of the message, or by enabling
  "Full Search", to search anywhere in the message. Example: run pptext, then
  type "ellipsis" in the dialog to jump to the ellipsis test results.
- A similar feature has been added to the Unicode Block dialog. The string
  typed can be the beginning of any word in the block's title. Alternatively,
  if you type the start of a 4-digit Unicode codepoint, it will jump to the
  block that contains that character, e.g. knowing that open single quote
  is `U+2018`, typing `201` will jump to General Punctuation, which has the
  range `2000-206f`. 
- Shift-clicking the Replace All button in the S/R dialog replaces all 
  "identical" matches to the current match. An example would be to search for
  words in italic markup, then if a LOTE word is found, all occurrences of
  that LOTE word can have a `lang` attribute added.
- Shift-clicking the Replace button in the Scannos dialog pops the S/R dialog
  pre-populated with the search and replace fields.
- View Options has been upgraded to make it easier to view messages one type
  at a time. Using Next Option will select the next available view option,
  and display messages of that type. Previous Option goes to the previous
  view option. Next/Previous respect the setting of "Grey out options with
  no matches".
- Illustration Fixup has a new button to "Preserve Illo's Page Number". If
  enabled, when moving an illo would take it across a page boundary, the
  page break locations are adjusted to keep the illo's page number the same.
  This is equivalent to keeping the illo where it was and moving the text
  around it. 
- Fix, Fix All, Hide, and Hide All buttons have been added to Scannos dialog.
- Selected text can now be dragged to another location in the file. If an 
  attempt is made to drag outside the screen, the selection may look incorrect
  until the text is dropped at the current mouse location. It is not possible
  to drag between the two split text windows.
- Holding one of Ctrl/Cmd/Shift modifier keys while dragging will copy
  selected text instead of moving. Dragging can be cancelled with Escape key.
- Any dialog may be "pinned", meaning that it will remain in front of the main
  window (not available on Linux). When pinned, a pin is shown in the title
  of the dialog. The current dialog may be pinned using Pin/Unpin Dialog in
  the View menu, or by right-clicking the dialog in an area where right-click
  is not normally used, i.e. most of the dialog except a list of messages.
  When you unpin a dialog, the title bar will say that it will be unpinned
  when it is next closed. Pinned dialogs are linked to the main window, so
  are raised, lowered, or iconized with the main window.
- Vowels with macros and vowels with breves have been added to the Common
  Characters dialog.
- "Include File" has been added to the file menu to insert a file at the
  current location.
- Footnotes ending in `...]*` are now marked as "CONTINUED" in Footnote Fixup.
- Regexes now support `\N` which converts a matched Roman numeral string
  (optionally including spaces) to a regular, Arabic number. This is to
  support adding `abbr` markup, e.g. `<abbr title="8">VIII</abbr>`.
- Support for curly quote conversion in HTML files has been added via Protect
  and Restore HTML Straight Quotes, which protect straight quotes used within
  HTML elements by replacing them with an obscure character, like the online
  ppsmq tool. Normal curly quote conversion can then be run, and the quotes
  restored once this is complete.
- Compose Help dialog can now be sorted by clicking in the header of any
  column. Clicking again reverses the sort.
- The verbosity of more sections of the pptext report has been reduced.
- HTML tags are now stripped from the selected text passed to a Custom command
  with the `$t` token.
- The `blockquote` element is used for blockquotes instead of a `div`.
- Chapter `h2` markup is closed if poetry is detected in header.
- Pressing Home or Cmd-Left already moved the insert cursor to the start of
  the current line. Pressing it again will now move to the first non-space
  character.
- PPhtml checks music files in a similar way to image files.
- PPhtml no longer reports `www.w3.org` links in the HTML header.
- Shadow command for "delete next character" added to Command Palette.
- "Highlight Surrounding Quotes & Brackets" now ignores apostrophes that are
  surrounded by letters.
- Default CSS for gesperrt has been improved, including a fallback for epub2.

### Bug fixes

- Using the Recent Files menu, and possibly other methods of loading a file,
  could make Guiguts crash instantly and silently.
- Music files were not zipped up to send to ebookmaker.
- If the user ignored the red "bad regex" indication in the S/R dialog and
  searched for the regex, an exception occurred.

  generation.

  every 5 minutes (configurable in Prefs dialog) 
- The Prefs file (where settings are saved) is now backed up so that a "day-"
  and "week-old" version should be retained in the same directory, which can
  be restored if the original becomes corrupted. Now that many settings,
  including Custom menu entries, are saved in the Prefs file, it would be
  more disruptive if Pref file's contents were lost. Procedure: quit Guiguts;
  rename `GGprefs.json` to `GGprefs_corrupt.json`; rename `GGprefs_day.json`
  to `GGprefs.json`; restart Guiguts; if problem not resolved, repeat the
  above, but restoring `GGprefs_week.json`
- Custom Menu added, similar to GG1, but read help in dialog or manual page
  for more details, including how to link to source scans at IA or Hathi Trust
- IMPORTANT note for users upgrading from earlier alpha versions: the location
  of the ebookmaker directory/folder must be re-selected - it is now where
  the `pipenv install ebookmaker` command was run, rather than the ebookmaker
  script in the virtual environment.
- If ebookmaker is installed on user's computer, it can be run from within
  GG on all platforms. Normally runs in verbose mode, but "Verbose" checkbox
  enables further verbosity (mostly for debugging)
- Ebookmaker messages can be sorted by severity; "Suspects only" can be used
  to filter out debug/information messages.
- Command Palette has been added, accessible via the Help menu, or using
  Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P: it lists all the commands available, and user can type
  part of the command to filter the list, then run the command with the "Run"
  button, or the "Enter/Return" key or double clicking the command. In addition
  to being a feature in its own right, it is intended to use this work to
  support the addition of user-defined shortcut keys in a future release
- Proofer comments can now be deleted, via button or Cmd/Ctrl-clicking in
  Proofer Comments dialog
- Highlighting of current cursor line can be disabled via Prefs dialog
- Display of tooltips can be disabled via Prefs dialog
- End-of-page blank lines, and end-of-line spaces are deleted automatically
  when file is saved

- Show/Hide Image Viewer menu buttons replaced with Image Viewer checkbox
- All checker dialogs now output "Check complete" at the bottom of the list

  the status bar (i.e. single character selected, or character after cursor)
  the information on that character is displayed

- The current cursor line displayed oddly in combination with split window -
  a known issue is that the cursor line from the other half of the split
  will be displayed (faintly) in the split window
- Footnote reindexing could give incorrect output where multiple footnote
  anchors were on the same line of text
- WF treated underscores as word characters in an inconsistent manner
- Very small image viewer scale factors could cause a traceback


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.16

- The user can now use an external viewer to display scan files, instead of,
  or in addition to, the internal viewer. If the user does not specify a
  particular viewer, the computer's default viewer for PNG files will be used.
  Typically, this is the viewer that would open a PNG file when the operating
  system is asked to "open" or "view" the file, or it is double-clicked when
  using Windows. Alternatively the user can choose a specific viewer, such as
  `XnView` on Windows, `Pixea` on macOS, or `eog -w` on Linux, which will then
  be used instead of the computer's default viewer.
- Help->About Guiguts now reports version numbers and is easier to copy
  when reporting a bug
- A High Contrast preference option increases the contrast of the main text
  window and internal image viewer, i.e. black on white or white on black

  (CSS2.1 or CSS3) and report on the CSS block at the top of the file
- All checker dialogs now have buttons to hide (and fix if appropriate) the
  selected message, instead of requiring use of Cmd/Ctrl with mouse clicks
- The "Default" theme is now dark or light depending on the current operating
  system setting - the user can still choose Dark or Light explicitly
- Clicking (and dragging) in the line numbers on the left now selects whole
  lines of text. Although it is not possible to drag beyond the height of
  the window, large sections of text can be selected by clicking to select
  the first line, scrolling down, then Shift-clicking to select the last
  line. Shift-clicking and dragging extends/reduces the selection in a similar
  way to the behavior in the main text window. The mouse scroll wheel should
  also scroll the text window even when the mouse is in the line numbers
- Checker View Options (e.g. Bookloupe) now mean "show" when checked, rather
  than "hide"
- Checker View Options now have a checkbox to allow the graying out of view
  options that do not match any messages in the checker dialog - in addition
  the number of matching messages is shown next to each view option

  queries independently
- PPhtml check has been added, based on a combination of the PPWB tool and the
  tool bundled with Guiguts 1 
- A link to the online Post-Processors' Workbench is now in the HTML menu

  which increases the vertical spacing between lines of text, and for cursor
  width which can be increased to make it more visible
- A few small improvements have been made to PPtxt's report
- Spell check does not highlight all the spelling queries in blue
- Ebookmaker check has been added to the HTML menu. Checkboxes determine which
  formats will be created in the project directory. The user must first 
  install ebookmaker according to the instructions here:
  https://github.com/gutenbergtools/ebookmaker/blob/master/README.md
  So far, this has been tested successfully  on Windows, but not on macOS or
  Linux. Feedback would be welcomed.
- An experimental feature to improve the display of Hebrew and Arabic text,
  which is displayed right to left (RTL), attempts to display the text in the
  correct direction. To paste Hebrew text on Windows, or Hebrew and Arabic
  text on Linux, use the new Edit Paste Hebrew/Arabic Text button. This
  reverses the text in a platform appropriate manner, and also adjusts it
  when the file is saved and reloaded. Do not attempt to paste a mixture of
  RTL and LTR text. As with all previous versions of Guiguts 1 and 2, if you
  position the insert cursor within the RTL text, characters may jump around
  unexpectedly, but will be restored when the cursor is moved away. Feedback
  would be welcomed.

### Bug fixes

- Footnote anchors were accidentally included in the autogenerated ToC
- Auto-illustration sometimes failed to spot the end of illo markup
- Sometimes when the window scrolled to show the latest search match, the
  match would be at the very edge of the screen making it hard to spot

  of the string are highlighted faintly, in addition to the first occurrence
  being selected as previously. These faint highlights are removes when
  the user begins a new search or closes the Search dialog
- The bookloupe tool has been added. Although it is not identical in 
  behavior to the old external tool, it essentially does the same checks
  and reports issues in a similar way. Most of the differences relate to
  changes in DP/PG texts since the forerunner of bookloupe (gutcheck) was
  first written, such as use of non-ASCII characters.
- When using Save As, GG2 now adds an appropriate extension, which is
  `.txt` unless the file has an HTML header, in which case it is `.html`.
  Also, if there is no filename, Save As suggests `untitled.txt`
- Illo/Sidenote Fixup now automatically select the first message when run
- HTML Autogeneration now reports more specific errors it discovers while
  running, and allows user to re-load the previous backup to fix them

### Bug fixes

- Could get warnings if preferences were removed in a previous release
- Asterisk thoughtbreaks were broken by rewrapping
- The first page number in HTML could get inserted before the HTML header
- Swap/delete space functions in curly quote check didn't always work

- The final footnote in the file could cause an error during HTML generation
- HTML Autogeneration didn't show the "busy" cursor to indicate it was working
- HTML Autogeneration didn't consider the last line of the file
- HTML Autogeneration didn't fail gracefully if the final chapter heading did
  not have 2 blank lines after it
- Rapidly cancelling the Search dialog with the Escape key while it was still
  working caused an error to occur


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.13

- HTML Autogeneration has been added. This performs basic conversion to HTML
  in a similar way to GG1. Other features such as image and table conversion
  are not included. To customize the HTML header, the user has two choices.
  The recommended method is to leave the default header as it is in
  `data/html/html_header.txt`, and create a new `html_header.txt` in their
  GGprefs folder which only contains CSS to override or add to the defaults.
  When the HTML file is generated, the default header will be inserted at
  the top of the file, and the user's header will be inserted at the bottom
  of the CSS, just before the closing `</style>` so that the user's CSS
  will override the earlier default settings. This method has the advantage
  that when future releases are made with adjustments to the default header,
  you will not usually need to edit your customized header text.
  The alternative method, which does not have this advantage, is to
  copy the file `html_header.txt` from the `data/html` folder in the
  release into their GGprefs folder and edit it there. That file will be
  used as the complete header for generated HTML files. If the default
  header is altered in a future release, you would need to either copy across
  any new changes into your header, or copy the whole file across and make
  your customizing edits again.
- There is a manual page for all the features currently in GG2. The top level
  of the manual is https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/PPTools/Guiguts/Guiguts_2_Manual
- Pressing the F1 function key in any dialog brings up the manual page for
  that dialog
- Checker dialogs, e.g. Jeebies, now have a Copy Results button which copies
  all the messages from the dialog to the clipboard, so the user can paste
  them elsewhere to help with reporting issues or to analyze results
- Regex Cheat Sheet link added to Help menu
- Search dialog now has a First (or Last) button. This finds the first
  occurrence of the search term in the file (or last if Reverse searching).
  This is equivalent to Start at Beginning, followed by Search in GG1
- Each checker dialog, e.g. Jeebies and Spell check, now has its own settings
  for sorting the messages, either by line/column or by type/alphabetic
- PPtext now reports occurrences of multiple spaces/dashes once per line
  rather than every occurrence. The number of occurrences on the line
  is displayed in the error message 
- Detection of mid-paragraph illustrations/sidenotes has been improved
- Pressing "R&S" in the Search dialog after pressing Replace now does
  a Search
- Highlight colors have been adjusted for dark themes.

### Bug Fixes

  of the line during curly quote conversion
- Blank lines at page breaks could be lost during rewrap

  and dragged outside the window. Also other column-selection bugs.

- Illustration/Sidenote Fixup could move the wrong lines if the file had been
  edited since the tool was first run
- When selecting text to make an edit within an orange spotlighted piece of
  text, the selection was not visible
- Word Frequency and Search's ideas of what constitutes a word were
  inconsistent meaning that some "words" found by WF could not be found by
  searching
- Some ellipses were reported as "double punctuation" by PPtext
- Using Ctrl/Cmd+0 to fit the image to the image viewer window crashed if
  the image viewer was hidden at the time.


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.12
