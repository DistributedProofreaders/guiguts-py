# Changelog


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.16

- The user can now use an external viewer to display scan files, instead of,
  or in addition to, the internal viewer. If the user does not specify a
  particular viewer, the computer's default viewer for PNG files will be used.
  Typically, this is the viewer that would open a PNG file when the operating
  system is asked to "open" or "view" the file, or it is double-clicked when
  using Windows. Alternatively the user can choose a specific viewer, such as
  `XnView` on Windows, `Pixea` on macOS, or `eog -w` on Linux, which will then
  be used instead of the computer's default viewer.
- Help->About Guiguts now reports version numbers and is easier to copy
  when reporting a bug
- A High Contrast preference option increases the contrast of the main text
  window and internal image viewer, i.e. black on white or white on black
- Highlight HTML Tags in the Search menu displays HTML tags in color to make
  it easier to edit HTML files
- Image Viewer now has auto fit-to-height and fit-to-width buttons
- CSS Validator in the HTML menu uses the online W3C validator to validate
  (CSS2.1 or CSS3) and report on the CSS block at the top of the file
- All checker dialogs now have buttons to hide (and fix if appropriate) the
  selected message, instead of requiring use of Cmd/Ctrl with mouse clicks
- The "Default" theme is now dark or light depending on the current operating
  system setting - the user can still choose Dark or Light explicitly
- Clicking (and dragging) in the line numbers on the left now selects whole
  lines of text. Although it is not possible to drag beyond the height of
  the window, large sections of text can be selected by clicking to select
  the first line, scrolling down, then Shift-clicking to select the last
  line. Shift-clicking and dragging extends/reduces the selection in a similar
  way to the behavior in the main text window. The mouse scroll wheel should
  also scroll the text window even when the mouse is in the line numbers
- Checker View Options (e.g. Bookloupe) now mean "show" when checked, rather
  than "hide"
- Checker View Options now have a checkbox to allow the graying out of view
  options that do not match any messages in the checker dialog - in addition
  the number of matching messages is shown next to each view option 
- Curly Quotes now has View Options to allow hide/show of single/double quote
  queries independently
- PPhtml check has been added, based on a combination of the PPWB tool and the
  tool bundled with Guiguts 1 
- A link to the online Post-Processors' Workbench is now in the HTML menu
- The Preferences dialog now has tabs to split the different preferences into
  sections
- A new Advanced tab in the Preferences dialog has settings for line spacing
  which increases the vertical spacing between lines of text, and for cursor
  width which can be increased to make it more visible
- A few small improvements have been made to PPtxt's report
- Spell check does not highlight all the spelling queries in blue
- Ebookmaker check has been added to the HTML menu. Checkboxes determine which
  formats will be created in the project directory. The user must first 
  install ebookmaker according to the instructions here:
  https://github.com/gutenbergtools/ebookmaker/blob/master/README.md
  So far, this has been tested successfully  on Windows, but not on macOS or
  Linux. Feedback would be welcomed.
- An experimental feature to improve the display of Hebrew and Arabic text,
  which is displayed right to left (RTL), attempts to display the text in the
  correct direction. To paste Hebrew text on Windows, or Hebrew and Arabic
  text on Linux, use the new Edit Paste Hebrew/Arabic Text button. This
  reverses the text in a platform appropriate manner, and also adjusts it
  when the file is saved and reloaded. Do not attempt to paste a mixture of
  RTL and LTR text. As with all previous versions of Guiguts 1 and 2, if you
  position the insert cursor within the RTL text, characters may jump around
  unexpectedly, but will be restored when the cursor is moved away. Feedback
  would be welcomed.

### Bug fixes

- Auto-illustration sometimes failed to spot the end of illo markup
- Sometimes when the window scrolled to show the latest search match, the
  match would be at the very edge of the screen making it hard to spot

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.14

- When using the Search dialog to search for a string, all occurrences
  of the string are highlighted faintly, in addition to the first occurrence
  being selected as previously. These faint highlights are removes when
  the user begins a new search or closes the Search dialog
- The bookloupe tool has been added. Although it is not identical in 
  behavior to the old external tool, it essentially does the same checks
  and reports issues in a similar way. Most of the differences relate to
  changes in DP/PG texts since the forerunner of bookloupe (gutcheck) was
  first written, such as use of non-ASCII characters.
- When using Save As, GG2 now adds an appropriate extension, which is
  `.txt` unless the file has an HTML header, in which case it is `.html`.
  Also, if there is no filename, Save As suggests `untitled.txt`
- Illo/Sidenote Fixup now automatically select the first message when run
- HTML Autogeneration now reports more specific errors it discovers while
  running, and allows user to re-load the previous backup to fix them

### Bug fixes

- Orange spotlights were hidden when doing Find All within a selection
- Could get warnings if preferences were removed in a previous release
- Asterisk thoughtbreaks were broken by rewrapping
- The first page number in HTML could get inserted before the HTML header
- Swap/delete space functions in curly quote check didn't always work
- Using undo/redo did not cause Sidenote/Illo Fixup to recalculate positions
- The final footnote in the file could cause an error during HTML generation
- HTML Autogeneration didn't show the "busy" cursor to indicate it was working
- HTML Autogeneration didn't consider the last line of the file
- HTML Autogeneration didn't fail gracefully if the final chapter heading did
  not have 2 blank lines after it
- Rapidly cancelling the Search dialog with the Escape key while it was still
  working caused an error to occur


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.13

- HTML Autogeneration has been added. This performs basic conversion to HTML
  in a similar way to GG1. Other features such as image and table conversion
  are not included. To customize the HTML header, the user has two choices.
  The recommended method is to leave the default header as it is in
  `data/html/html_header.txt`, and create a new `html_header.txt` in their
  GGprefs folder which only contains CSS to override or add to the defaults.
  When the HTML file is generated, the default header will be inserted at
  the top of the file, and the user's header will be inserted at the bottom
  of the CSS, just before the closing `</style>` so that the user's CSS
  will override the earlier default settings. This method has the advantage
  that when future releases are made with adjustments to the default header,
  you will not usually need to edit your customized header text.
  The alternative method, which does not have this advantage, is to
  copy the file `html_header.txt` from the `data/html` folder in the
  release into their GGprefs folder and edit it there. That file will be
  used as the complete header for generated HTML files. If the default
  header is altered in a future release, you would need to either copy across
  any new changes into your header, or copy the whole file across and make
  your customizing edits again.
- There is a manual page for all the features currently in GG2. The top level
  of the manual is https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/PPTools/Guiguts/Guiguts_2_Manual
- Pressing the F1 function key in any dialog brings up the manual page for
  that dialog
- Checker dialogs, e.g. Jeebies, now have a Copy Results button which copies
  all the messages from the dialog to the clipboard, so the user can paste
  them elsewhere to help with reporting issues or to analyze results
- Regex Cheat Sheet link added to Help menu
- Search dialog now has a First (or Last) button. This finds the first
  occurrence of the search term in the file (or last if Reverse searching).
  This is equivalent to Start at Beginning, followed by Search in GG1
- Each checker dialog, e.g. Jeebies and Spell check, now has its own settings
  for sorting the messages, either by line/column or by type/alphabetic
- PPtext now reports occurrences of multiple spaces/dashes once per line
  rather than every occurrence. The number of occurrences on the line
  is displayed in the error message 
- Detection of mid-paragraph illustrations/sidenotes has been improved
- Pressing "R&S" in the Search dialog after pressing Replace now does
  a Search
- Highlight colors have been adjusted for dark themes.

### Bug Fixes

- Ditto marks were not recognized if they appeared at the beginning or end
  of the line during curly quote conversion
- Blank lines at page breaks could be lost during rewrap
- Case changes required several Undo clicks to undo the changes made
- The text window could fail to scroll correctly when the mouse was clicked
  and dragged outside the window. Also other column-selection bugs.
- Multi-paragraph footnotes didn't "move to paragraph" correctly
- Illustration/Sidenote Fixup could move the wrong lines if the file had been
  edited since the tool was first run
- When selecting text to make an edit within an orange spotlighted piece of
  text, the selection was not visible
- Word Frequency and Search's ideas of what constitutes a word were
  inconsistent meaning that some "words" found by WF could not be found by
  searching
- Some ellipses were reported as "double punctuation" by PPtext
- Using Ctrl/Cmd+0 to fit the image to the image viewer window crashed if
  the image viewer was hidden at the time.


## Version 2.0.0-alpha.12
