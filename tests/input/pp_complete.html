  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c009'>In the course of collecting materials for my “Handbook of
Fictitious Names of Authors of the Nineteenth Century,” I
came across the titles of a number of works purporting to
be written by “A Lady,” the authorship of which appeared
to be unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'>It occurred to me that I might probably ascertain the
names of many of the authors, and also proper descriptions
of such of the books as I had not seen, and was unable
to see, if I printed a list of them. As however, the essential
points to be attended to, in the proper description of
a book, are little understood, I thought it would be desirable
to prefix to the list a few suggestions on the way to
supply correct information. These gradually developed, so
that I soon found the subject required more space, more
time, and more consideration than I at first imagined.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the hope that I might obtain assistance from others,
and with a view to getting hints and exciting discussion,
I wrote an article for “Notes and Queries,” which was
printed in the numbers for January and April of 1872,
entitled, “How to describe a Book.” I now go more fully
into the matters that I consider require attention in the
proper description of a book.</p>

<p class='c010'>An explanation of the title of this essay will no doubt
be looked for in the preface. It is very simple. In my
searches for the Authors’ names, the ladies in this list
have resisted all enquiry in the most aggravating manner.
Therefore I took the title of Aggravating Ladies as being
concise and appropriate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The information asked for relates only to English Literature
of the 19th century, to which period I confine myself
entirely. The anonymous and pseudonymous writers
during this century being more than sufficient to occupy
a whole life of laborious application.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>I have not included in the list any phrases such as:—A
Lady of Rank—A Lady of Distinction—A Lady of Hebrew
faith—A Banished Lady—A Young Lady—A too generous
Young Lady—nor, A Lady of distinction, who has witnessed
and attentively studied what is esteemed truly graceful and
elegant amongst the most refined nations of Europe (!) The
pseudonym of the author of The Mirror of the Graces, or an
English lady’s costume [treating of] … taste … grace; modesty
… dress …; rank … in life; … of accomplishments; … the mind
… means of preserving beauty …; by a lady, &#38;c. London,
Crosby &#38; Co., 1811.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand I have inserted some titles which have
been entered in different catalogues as by “a lady,” when
those words do not occur on the title. Such works probably
being really written by a lady, the publisher naturally desired
they should go forth with that impress of good faith
and with all the prestige attaching to that talismanic little
word.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I have already explained, my list comprises only works
published in the present century, whose authors are unknown
to me. I have a longer list of works by “a lady,” whose
names are known, and who have therefore ceased to be aggravating.
I do not give the title when I know the name of
the author because I am now seeking not supplying information.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another list as long as that I give at the end I have not
printed, not having been able to see the books themselves
so as to describe them from actual inspection.</p>

<p class='c010'>I shall be grateful for information as to any of the works,
or the lives of these Aggravating Ladies.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>What’s in a name?</p>

<p class='c014'>Ask the booksellers, and they will tell you, <em>much</em> in the title-page
of a new book.…</p>

<p class='c014'>The making up of a taking title-page, seems to have been
the peculiar province of the bookseller, time out of mind.—<cite>Fly
leaves.… London</cite> [published and edited by] <cite>John
Miller</cite>, 1854.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a perusal of my list I think every gentleman will
agree with me that Ladies really are very aggravating. It
would be curious to hear the exclamation of any lady who
has written as “A lady,” upon looking it over. She would
probably exclaim that when she wrote as “A lady,” she
thought she was the only one, or at all events one of the
first.</p>

<p class='c010'>The authoress of: “How to dress on £15 a year as a
lady, by a lady,” would no doubt be surprised to find such
a long list for the present century alone. I mention this
flowing and somewhat vigorously written little work; but it
is of too recent a date for me to make any enquiry for the
author’s name, especially as it is a secret that, from the present
popularity of the book, is not likely to be long kept.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
For I have remarked that though these ladies do not like
placing their names on their books, yet there is little desire
to disguise the authorship, and enquiries are generally soon
satisfied if a work has attained any success. They like
to see themselves in print, so long as there is no infringement
of the patent of modesty.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The inference from this is that my list is composed chiefly
of works that have not become famous or popular, which is
the fact. If secresy were their object, it has to the present
time been attained, for they have defied my researches.
Nevertheless I believe that to some one of the author’s
friends or relations she has been known, but “no man is a
prophet in his own country,” and friends and relations very
often care too little for what literary ladies are doing to
follow Captain Cuttle’s advice and “make a note” of an
author’s name. Knowledge is often the greatest enemy to
the recording of facts. People often know so well whom a
book is by, that they are not even aware of its pseudonimity.
The majority of novel readers never know the name of the
author, nor do they care to enquire, and much prefer reading
a novel “By the author of” some previous work which has
interested them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In many cases I am asking for information which the
authoresses do not conceal, and which is well known though
unknown to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus I ascribe my not knowing the name of the author
rather to the fact of there being no one to make a note of it
when found, than any desire on the fair writer’s part to remain
unknown. When a lady has written her first work as “a
lady” she seldom adopts that denomination in her second
work; but more frequently uses the term “By the author of”
the previous work, or “By a lady, author of,” etc.</p>

<hr class='c016'>
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Since this was written (1875) the author’s name has been
divulged, and there has also been a Chancery Suit in relation to the
work. I have put the book in the list which follows as an illustration
of some of my remarks.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>HOW TO DESCRIBE A BOOK.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>“If you are troubled with a pride of accuracy, and would
have it completely taken out of you, print a catalogue.”
(Author unknown).</p>
<p class='c017'>Dr. Aikin used to say, that nothing is such an obstacle to
the production of excellence as the power of producing
what is pretty good with ease and rapidity. <cite>The Circulator</cite>
[1825] quoted in the Manual of Laconics by John
Taylor, 1838, p. 361.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice is the best, if not the only way to learn how to describe
a book. Simply reading descriptions of what to do is of
little use. Indeed practice is found to teach so much, that we
often find authors of bibliographical books cancelling the early
portions of their works in order to correct those defects and
deficiencies which experience has brought forcibly to their
notice. Such was the case with the first part of Quérard’s
France Littéraire, which was called in and cancelled; and the
Bibliotheca Cornubiensis of Boase and Courtney, published
by Longmans in 1874.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every one must be guided by their particular requirements;
but must never lose sight of the absolute necessity there is
of following a system rigidly, and of being accurate.</p>

<p class='c010'>With these preliminary remarks I will now proceed to give
some hints derived from my own experience.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CATALOGUING.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>“The sheet-anchor of cataloguing-work, as of all other true
work that a man has to do, is accuracy.”—<cite>Edward Edwards</cite>
(Memoirs of Libraries, 1859, vol. II. 868).</p>
<p class='c017'>… “l’exactitude est le meilleur fondment du succès des
livres de bibliographie.”—Quérard, Omissions et bévues
du livre intitulé La Littérature Française contemporaine
… 1848, p. xv.</p>
<p class='c017'>“As bibliographers, we cannot indeed but wish, that the
catalogue of every library were a bibliographical dictionary
of its books…. There is no species of literary labor so
arduous, or which makes so extensive demands upon the
learning of the author, as that of the preparation of such
works.”—Smithsonian Report on the construction of catalogues.…
By C. C. Jewett.… 1853, p. 10.</p>
<p class='c017'>“It is impossible to labor successfully, without a rigid
adherence to rules. Although such rules be not formally
enunciated, they must exist in the mind of the cataloguer
and guide him, or the result of his labors will be mortifying
and unprofitable.”—Ibid, p. 17.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have used the word Bibliography, but I must warn the
student that it is meaningless, or, rather, its meanings are
so numerous and varied, being used for every sort of thing
connected with books, that for any scientific purpose the
word is useless. Bibliotheca also is used amongst other
things to express a miscellaneous collection of titles; whether
good, bad, or indifferent, matters little.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is wanted is a short word which shall express
that a book is accurately described. The word catalogue
is worse for its indefinite meaning than bibliotheca or bibliography.
The science or art of describing books has no
technical term.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In describing books, accuracy is the one thing to attain.
And the object should be so to describe the book, that anybody
else shall be certain from the description that a particular
book they have in hand is the one described.</p>

<p class='c010'>So difficult did Prof. De Morgan consider this, with regard
to early printed books that he said if he had to do his work
on “Arithmetical Books” over again he would invariably
describe some defect or error in the printing.</p>

<p class='c010'>I now propose to give some hints on this subject, premising
that there is at present no “Grammar” of Bibliography—nothing
settled, no recognized authority.</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing a person were about to make a catalogue of a
library, or even of a few books, the first thing to do is to lay
down certain rules, to be strictly adhered to, or adopt rules
laid down by another for that purpose. This has been done
for many years past by the librarians of our National Library.
So that there at least we have a Catalogue that we can depend
upon so far as it goes: how far that is the rules inform
us. Several of them simply provide against the prevailing
loose notions of cataloguing. Rules for example to tell us
that titles are written straight on as they are found, or in
the language in which the book is written and not in another,
read like satires on ignorance. And yet how necessary they
are.</p>

<p class='c010'>These rules, invaluable as a guide to every catalogue
maker, will be found printed in the: Catalogue of printed
books in the British Museum, volume 1. London, printed
by order of the trustees, MDCCCXLI, in folio; the Preface is
signed by the editor Sir Antonio Panizzi, and examples of the
rules will be found in: A handbook for Readers at the British
Museum, by Thomas Nichols, assistant in the British Museum,
London, Longman, 1866, p. 51. This useful little work unfortunately
has no index. A catalogue drawn up according
to the rules of the Museum will be found in: “A list of
the books of reference in the Reading room of the British
Museum.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The rules are ninety-one in number but for small libraries
where provision is not required for every language under the
sun, a smaller number would be sufficient.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Whatever rules are determined upon should be printed
in the catalogue, so that those who consult it may know at
once whether or not they are likely to find what they want
and how.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c010'>The first question that arises is the amount of title page
information to be given. To abbreviate or not abbreviate
becomes the difficult question. It generally resolves itself
into one of expense, and abbreviated titles are determined
upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>I now therefore treat of the matter as it is, and not as it
should be, for if I treated it as it should be, namely with
full titles, I should have little to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>He must have been a bold man who first began to abbreviate
titles for a catalogue. It is a most unsatisfactory practice,
though now having long precedent for its use. It is
like cutting off a leg or an arm, the body can still go on, it
is true, but it is nevertheless mutilated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more title page information a bibliotheca gives the
greater will be its usefulness. Everything, however, is subordinate
to the proper description of the book. If that is
done upon certain principles and rules, the cataloguer will
at least be consistent, which few of the present day are.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every word of a title may be given and yet be inaccurate,
on the other hand half the title may be left out and yet be
accurate<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> though not perfect as I shall presently show.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ordinary and most popular way of referring to or
describing a book is to reverse everything and alter the title.
For example, let us suppose it is stated that in 1868 Messrs.
Longman published an octavo volume of 800 pages by George
Brown, entitled a Treatise on the best mode of ventilation.
Here everything is topsy turvy, besides being incorrectly
called a treatise instead of an essay.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The proper title
being: An historical essay on ventilation, by George Brown,
London, Longman, 1868, octavo, pp. xv. 786.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instances of this kind of thing the student will find at
every turn, in every publication, periodical or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Another bad practice is cutting short the title page and
explaining in a note what the book is about almost in the
words of the author, so that all the necessary information is
given, only incorrectly instead of correctly, an example of
which, taken from Lowndes, will be found in my list.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difficulty is not to find instances of looseness in describing
books, but to find instances where they are properly
described. I know of few bibliothecas, English or foreign, that
can be relied on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably these will appear to some trivial matters. Yet
what thought and anxious consideration do most authors
give to the titles of their works, before they finally suit their
fancy; frequently, indeed, not being satisfied with them as
sent forth to the world. How has the author considered
whether he will put his own name, or whether he will write
under a fictitious name, or his initials, or simply call himself
“A Gentleman,” or designate himself by the office he holds
as “A Magistrate.” Then, with what difficulty has he at
last settled upon a publisher, and for what a number of
reasons may he have done so. And yet some ruthless barbarian,
who is totally ignorant of all the trouble that has
been taken, and who knows nothing of the subject, cuts down
our author’s title without hesitation. Or perhaps, what is
still more astonishing, an author himself, although he has
given the matter so much thought, will sometimes on being
asked, send a list of his works, in which not a single title
shall be correct, in which he will leave out all the first words,
erroneously state the subject as in the book instead of as it
appears on the title page: omit to say when published,
whether with his own name or not; and, finally, and almost
invariably, leave out the publisher’s name, which cost him
so much pains to decide on.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>OF DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>Catalogues must have nothing to do with distinctions
between celebrity and obscurity. They must aim at serving
the tyro no less than the professor.—<cite>Edward Edwards</cite>
(Memoirs of Libraries, 1859, II., p. 836).</p>

<p class='c009'>Books may be classed under four heads, namely (1) Autonymous—(2)
Polyonymous—(3) Pseudonymous, and—(4)
Anonymous.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Autonymous, the first and most common is with the
author’s name either on the title-page, or if not on the title-page,
signed to a preface, introduction, letter, or dedication,
or in some part of the book, or at the end. Speeches though
usually anonymous with regard to the reporting or editing,
are frequently catalogued under the name of the speaker as
autonymous.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Polyonymous, is with several authors’ names. It is
usual to enter them under the name of the first author, with
cross references from the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Pseudonymous, without the author’s name, but with
a fictitious name or designation, thus giving some indication
as to the author, though possibly a very slight one. No
matter in what part of the book the pseudonym appears, the
work is pseudonymous.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In cataloguing, the pseudonym should no more be left out,
than the author’s name. If an author uses a pseudonym on
the title, but gives his real name in the book, it is not pseudonymous,
but must be catalogued as autonymous. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>case, as in all others, the pseudonym should be given, even if
the title is abbreviated. In fact the pseudonym for bibliographical
purposes takes the place of the author’s name. I
have not space here to enumerate the different classes of
pseudonyms, of which there are many varieties.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>4. Lastly an Anonymous book is one without the author’s
name, whether on the title page, or any part of the book.
The word anonymous has been and still is very indiscriminately
used to include pseudonymous. The cataloguer must
be careful not to be betrayed into this error so fruitful of
inaccuracy. This class of books has resisted the most strenuous
efforts of the learned to bring it within rules, every
rule for cataloguing such books requiring an exception. With
anonymous works having simple titles, such as “Aggravating
Ladies” (supposing a work to be published anonymously
with such a title) the task is easy. Though even this
example will illustrate the difficulty of the subject, for there
are only two words and there are two ways of cataloguing,
each having advantages. By one system it would come
under “Aggravating” and by the other under “Ladies.”
According to the system of Audiffredi<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and of Barbier<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and of a similar work on English authors<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a>, it would be
catalogued by the first word, and for such works this is the
most approved method<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. According to the Rules of the
British Museum it would be catalogued under Ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'>It affords matter for consideration when we find it stated
that “An anonymous work is seldom read with confidence or
quoted as an authority.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Many publications intended expressly for youth, and therefore
requiring some guarantee that they are fit for the purpose,
are published without the author’s name, though frequently
with an indication of sex.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may probably be that little as is the credit given to the
anonymous or pseudonymous work, for in the above quotation
both are meant, it would obtain less if it had the author’s
real name<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>To shew that a book was published without the author’s
name, whether anonymous or pseudonymous, some bibliographers
have put an asterisk or star at the beginning of the
title. I am not aware that this, or indeed any plan has
systematically been adopted in any English work, except
within the last few years. In his learned Essay On the Literature
of Political economy, p. x, J. R. McCulloch says:
“When the name of the author of a work is included between
brackets, it shows that it was published anonymously.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>uses anonymous here in the sense of without the author’s
name, and to include pseudonymous. I made use of the star
in the Handbook of Fictitious Names in 1868, but only to
indicate anonymity, and not as Quérard uses it. In Notes
and Queries for the 6th April, 1872, I suggested the adoption
of a line — to shew that a book was published pseudonymously.
And I made use of both signs in my Bibliographical
list of Lord Brougham’s publications. These
signs have the advantage of attracting the eye, and declaring
at once the class of book. On the other hand they
cannot be used for foot notes, are likely to be overlooked
in printing, and there is always great difficulty in
getting readers to find out what signs mean. On the whole
after much consideration I have determined for the future
to use simply abbreviations of the words anonymous and
pseudonymous which everybody understands without explanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>As in describing a book the principal object is to enable
the student to identify it, so that there may be no doubt that
the cataloguer’s remarks upon a certain book apply to that for
which the reader is searching. It is less important that autonymous
works should be catalogued so fully as anonymous,
<a id='tn-because'></a>because the author’s name is at once a guide. For though
two autonymous works bear the same title their authors’
names would be different. But not so with two anonymous
works having the same title.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pseudonymous works, in which the pseudonym is a name
and not a phrase or denomination, would come in the same
category.</p>

<p class='c010'>For anonymous, and frequently for pseudonymous works
it is not only desirable to give the full title, but to supplement
it with any further information that will help identification.
As for example, if the book is printed at a different
place to that of sale or publication<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> or if dated and addressed
from what would appear to be the author’s residence,
or if there is any allusion in the work or the advertisements<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
to other publications of the same author. Examples of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>all will be found in my list. Though a book be anonymous
so far as the title page informs us, yet if pseudonymous from
the preface or introduction being signed with a fictitious
name, or with initials or denomination, or other qualification,
it should be catalogued as pseudonymous. Thus following
the rule with regard to autonyms. Except when signed:—The
Author, The Editor, The Translator, Himself, or Herself,
of which it is best to take no notice, even if on the title.
Such works should be considered anonymous without even
giving cross-references from those words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of whatever description, whether autonymous, or anonymous,
or pseudonymous, the first words of the title, or the
half title, should be quoted correctly, and exactly as they
occur, and to this rule there should be no exception, whether
for bibliographical lists, or for the purpose of citation as an
authority. For in the latter case, however familiar the work
cited may be, there are sure to be readers unfamiliar with it,
to whom a loose reference will cause trouble. The half title
or any abbreviation of the title, if used by the author of the
book may be adopted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Few things cause greater waste of time amongst literary
men than the habitually careless manner in which they give
references. Not only should a book be correctly described,
but the edition or date and page ought to be added. Bibliographers
(which term I here use to mean persons who have
concerned themselves with the description of books) have
sinned terribly in this respect by giving descriptions of books
at second, or even third-hand, and repeating the mistakes
and blunders of the original authority. Title pages are like
rumours, the oftener they are repeated the more incorrect
they become. The student should never rely upon a catalogue
for the description of a book, unless the compiler has
adhered strictly to rules. A statement in bibliothecas, biographical
dictionaries, or catalogues, that a work is anonymous,
can never be relied upon<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>After the first few words of the title every abbreviation or
omission should be indicated by three dots … close together
not thus.&#160;.&#160;. . This is a better method than using an
“etc.,” a sign which from the carelessness of authors is frequently
found on title-pages of books, and if used by both
authors and cataloguers we should never know which. As
few authors could explain the meaning of an “&#38;c.” on the
title, it is not likely that readers can guess.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been customary to omit mottoes without any indication
of the omission, and this has been done in one of the
most bibliographical works published in England<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. I
only know of one work of importance where special notice is
taken of such omissions.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>If a title page has a motto its omission should be shewn
thus [motto].</p>

<p class='c010'>To print mottoes when numerous or lengthy in an extensive
work seems quite out of the question. When short it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>is a luxury the bibliographer may occasionally indulge in.
I confess that this is one of the points I have felt extremely
puzzled about. I never abbreviate or omit anything from a
title-page without fear and trembling, which is intensified in
the case of mottoes. They frequently in one short verse, or
sentence, give the pith of a book, and my fear is that some
one in the future should wonder how I could be so stupid as
to suggest their omission.</p>

<p class='c010'>All additions should be indicated with the same care by
placing them between brackets [   ]. Additions in titles
should be as few and as short as possible, all explanatory
matter can be given in a note.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes authors use brackets or parentheses on the title
pages. When this is the case, if of no use or unimportant,
they should be left out by the cataloguer. For instance,
when an author has the words [Reprinted from, &#38;c.] in the
title. To omit the brackets is the least misleading, for if
left in it would look as if this information were not supplied
by the author, and if (<span lang="la"><i>sic</i></span>) were put it would not be understood
as referring to the brackets.</p>

on pseudonyms in the introduction to either edition of Quérard’s

M. Octave Delepierre’s “Supercheries littéraires, pastiches,” Londres,

that Barbier had not settled in his own mind at the date of the
above the first edition, what was an anonymous work. He describes
it as one upon the title page of which the author is not named, and he
then states that sometimes the author’s name is found in the work; but
he says it is the custom to class them all as anonymous and not to distinguish
different degrees of anonymity. In the second edition in
1826 he very properly eliminated so far as he was able such works
as contained the authors’ names. For many things the first edition
is better than the second, in which many of the titles we are told
were abbreviated. In the third and last and best edition, part of
which was published in 1872, his son, (see p. xxix., note) has so
far as he was able, re-instated such titles because so many editors
and others still continue to consider a work anonymous if the
author’s name does not occur on the title page. This is a step
backwards, and the sooner M. Olivier Barbier throws the editors

<p class='c009'>In cataloguing or describing a book six points at least
should be kept in view as necessary to its identification.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>(1.) Title.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2.) Name of author, and sometimes description.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3.) Place of publication.</p>

<p class='c010'>(4.) Publisher’s name, and sometimes address.</p>

<p class='c010'>(5.) The date of publication.</p>

<p class='c010'>(6.) The size.</p>

<p class='c010'>If full titles (that is, an exact transcript of the title from
beginning to the end), are given, it will only be necessary for
the cataloguer to supply in its proper, or most suitable place,
such of the above information as is not on the title-page.</p>

<p class='c010'>If abbreviations be adopted several considerations arise.</p>

<p class='c010'>(1.) As to so much of the title as occurs before the author’s
name we have already said that the first few words should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>be copied word for word, and afterwards every omission
should be denoted by dots.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2.) The name of the author should not be abbreviated, if
it renders it difficult to distinguish between two with the
same initials. If the author’s qualifications are omitted or
abbreviated, dots … of omission should be inserted. A description
after a name is often very important and useful in
determining the degree of credit to be attached to the work,
but they are frequently so numerous that they are too long
for most catalogues.</p>

<p class='c010'>Works in more than one volume generally have the number
on the title, as “In three volumes, vol 1.” Take no
notice of “Vol I.,” but invariably state the number of volumes
in the order in which it occurs on the title-page. The number
of volumes, however, is not always stated; in some works
each volume simply has “Vol I,” or “Vol II,” on the title,
when this is so, the number of volumes should be stated
after the date thus: “1873, in three volumes, octavo.”
The reader would then know whether the number of volumes
was stated on the title or not.</p>

<p class='c010'>There will be cases where this rule will not sufficiently
indicate the fact, as for instance, when the first does not,
but the second does, state the number of volumes. A note
will meet this case, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may appear to some that so trifling a matter is unworthy
of note, but with this the cataloguer has nothing to do. His
business is to note facts however trivial, whether anybody
should ever require them is not in his province.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3.) Place of publication. Several places of publication
are frequently given in the imprint of a book, when this is
the case, the first place should, at all events, be given, and
if the book is not printed as well as published there, the
place where it is printed should be stated.</p>

<p class='c010'>(4.) The Publisher’s name we seldom find in any list of
books. I never recollect to have seen it in any catalogue of
a library, and in very few bibliographical works. And yet
it is often of great importance. In cataloguing works without
the author’s name it should seldom if ever be omitted,
however much the title is abbreviated. The publisher’s
address may often be added with advantage, especially in
cases where he is little known. For many firms who have
been issuing works from the same house for a century or
even longer, it seems superfluous.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Both name and address of publishers may be abbreviated
without marks of omission, a rule having been made to that
effect, so that the reader may be apprised of the fact. Some
small elementary works have as many as ten or fifteen places
and double that number of publishers in the imprint, these
of course would not be given in full unless with some special
object.</p>

<p class='c010'>The publisher’s name when well known is also important
as frequently giving a character, or guarantee, if not of the
literary worth of a book, at all events of its sincerity.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the publisher is also the author, but does not signify
that fact, the book must be considered anonymous. The
publisher’s name (that is the author’s) must be repeated, as
would be the case if written by another person.</p>

<p class='c010'>Privately printed<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> works are frequently issued without
the name of a publisher or bookseller, though less frequently
without that of a printer, which if not on the title should be
supplied in parenthesis or in a note.</p>

<p class='c010'>(5.) The date of publication, if not on the title, will like
the author’s name, be frequently found in some other part
of the book. It should then be supplied after the last word
on the title in parenthesis. If not in the book, it should be
put between brackets [   ], and if uncertain with a note of
interrogation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stereotyped books are generally without dates of publication
for certain commercial reasons. Only superficial readers
are duped by the artifice, for the first object of the literary
student would be to determine approximately the date of
issue. When the preface is not dated it is no doubt as often
through thoughtlessness as intention.</p>

<p class='c010'>In quoting a work that has passed through numerous editions,
it is often useful to give the date of the first.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a practice amongst publishers of post dating books
issued towards the end of a year.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> This practice will
account for the dates of books in some bibliothecas, biographies
and catalogues, sometimes being a year earlier than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the date on the book. The title having been copied from
an advertisement or a review of the work apparently before
publication. When known to the cataloguer the actual year
of issue should be supplied in brackets immediately after
the date of the title.</p>

<p class='c010'>(6.) With the different descriptions of sizes of books Professor
De Morgan was so exasperated that after giving descriptions
of how the sheets of a book are folded he says,
“The words <i>folio</i>, <i>quarto</i>, <i>octavo</i>, <i>duodecimo</i>, <i>decimo-octavo</i>,
refer (in his book) entirely to size, as completely as in a
modern sale catalogue, the maker of which never looks at
the inside of a book to tell its form. All the very modern
distinctions of <i>imperial</i>, <i>royal</i>, <i>crown</i>, <i>atlas</i>, <i>demy</i>, &#38;c., &#38;c.,
&#38;c., I have relinquished to paper-makers and publishers, who
alone are able to understand them.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>All the words in use to describe sizes are useless. They
convey no definite idea to the reader, for the simple reason
that nothing definite as to size is meant. The only definite
meaning is that the paper is folded into certain divisions,
and not that the paper or print is of a particular size. A
quarto is often the size of an octavo, and an octavo the size
of a quarto, duodecimo, or anything else. Nevertheless
though not certain, the terms do in most cases, enable us to
guess at the probable or approximate size. The only way to
be certain of the size is to state it in inches.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Probably
few literary men would put up with the trouble of measuring.</p>

<p class='c010'>Compilers of Catalogues of modern books may content
themselves in most cases with the terms at present in use.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Novels are generally described in the advertisements as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“post octavo,” which is not octavo at all, but duodecimo.
The mis-description is of little importance, for everybody
knows about the size of the modern three volume novel,
a little larger now than at the beginning of the century.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is annoying that so small a matter as the size of a
book should occupy so much space. It has always been a
subject of difficulty. A bookseller as such, in his sale catalogues,
will describe a book as 12mo, but when he compiles
a bibliographical list he will describe it correctly as octavo,
though the actual size is what is looked upon as duodecimo.</p>

<p class='c010'>These points are strictly necessary for ordinary catalogues,
but they will not satisfy all enquiries, for we cannot tell
from them whether it is a book or a pamphlet that is described.
It is therefore desirable to add the number of pages.
In the paging we have as much variety as in the sizes,
authors, publishers, and printers, not having the slightest
thought for bibliographers, and the infinite trouble of collation.</p>

<p class='c010'>A book should be paged in as simple a manner as possible.
This is a rule that has never been attended to, and so long
as authors do not know their own minds never can be. If
the printer begins the paging regularly, and the author
thinks irregularly, and recollects something that has been
left out, irregular paging will be the result.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Always count from the very first printed page belonging
to the book, excluding advertisements. Give the paging as
printed, that is, in the same characters. If leaves occur unpaged,
either before those paged or after, use arabian numerals
to denote those unpaged.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Sometimes an octavo book begins with, say xii. numbered
pages and then occur four unnumbered, and then we have
page 1 on signature B, numbered consecutively to page 253,
and three pages of appendix and errata beyond. Describe it
thus: octavo pp. xii., and 4, and 253, and 3. But if 4 and 3
are numbered with roman numerals, it should be thus:—octavo,
pp. xii., and iv., 253, iii., because this is more accurate.
We use the same kind of numerals used in the book.
It is, however, not a matter of much moment, provided
the correct number of pages is given in the collation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not use the sign plus (xii.+iv.+iii.) because it makes
the figures look more uninteresting, and signs enough occur
in the titles themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The price at which a book is published is often unascertainable,
and it is useful to insert it, though it has nothing
to do with its literary or scientific value. But in this as in
every other particular it is impossible to say what the student
may require, and its omission might make a man of
genius waste precious hours which it is the special object of
the true bibliographer to save.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the price is mentioned on the title page, accuracy requires
that it be given in its regular order, whether at the
beginning or end of the title. Instances will be found in the
list of works by a lady at the end.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. This plan is advocated in a work I cannot too strongly recommend.
It is indispensable to every librarian. The learned author
thoroughly studied all the various systems in vogue, and founds almost
a code for the cataloguer upon them. It is the:—Smithsonian Report
on the construction of catalogues of libraries and their publication by
means of separate stereotyped titles, with rules and examples, by
Charles C. Jewett, Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, second
edition. Washington, published by the Smithsonian Institution,

generally preclude its being given in a bibliotheca. First we have the
preface vii pages, then a table of contents vii pages; the introduction
34 pages, a half-title unpaged, then 152 pages, then another half-title
unpaged, then pp. 44 and iii., then corrigenda pp. ix., then a
half-title and “the Dictionary,” forming a third of the book entirely
unpaged, then the addenda paged separately pp. 3. Sometimes the
figures of paging are at the side, sometimes in the middle, sometimes
at the top and sometimes at the bottom! Timperley in his “Printer’s
Manual” (1838) p. 18, says, “Running titles may be set to an index,
but folios are seldom put unless with a view to recommend the book
for its extraordinary number of pages; for as an index does not refer
to its own matter by figures, they are needless in this case.” When
the trouble that a variety of pagings gives the bibliographer, is considered,
it is to be hoped that the simplicity I recommend will be
adopted as much as possible.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STYLE OF PRINTING.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c009'>I now come to a few minor points of printing, for in a
catalogue nothing is so trivial as not to require attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the previous observations I have treated of things that
are invariable, they must be attended to, in any list of books,
there is no room for exercise of taste, they go to the very
root of a good catalogue, and are laws dictated by accuracy.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the manner in which a title is printed in a list or
catalogue, or biography is a matter of taste, and we therefore
give the following hints merely as suggestions<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a>, hoping
that they will commend themselves to all who print title-pages.
Have as few capitals as possible in the title, none
except for names of persons or places. Titles of persons may
well be printed without capitals, as prince, marquess, lord,
not Prince, Marquess, Lord.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take for example the following title, which, printed according
to the usual method would be:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speeches by the Lord Chancellor; Lord Brougham, Lord
Cottenham; and Lord Campbell, in The House of Lords, on
Tuesday the 9th, August, 1842, at giving Judgment in the
Appeal, the Rev. John Ferguson and others, Appellants,
against the Earl of Kinnoull, and the Rev. R. Young, Respondents,
with the Judgments appended, from Mr. Gurney’s
Shorthand notes,” &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>I prefer this title-page for catalogue purposes to be printed
thus:</p>

<p class='c010'>Speeches by the lord chancellor [Lyndhurst], lord Brougham,
lord Cottenham, and lord Campbell in the house of
lords, on tuesday the 9th august, 1842, at giving judgment
in the appeal, the rev. John Ferguson and others, appellants,
against the earl of Kinnoull and the rev. R. Young, respondents;
with the judgment appended from Mr. Gurney’s
shorthand notes. Edinb. James Gall and son [1842], 8o,
pp. 36, 1s. The improvement in appearance of this title and
the facility in reading, counterbalance all such objections
as that we are accustomed to Lord, and not lord, or Tuesday,
and not tuesday. The compilers of the [English] Law
List have long since discarded capitals for the names of
streets with great advantage, for example they print, “gray’s-inn-square,”
not Gray’s Inn Square: “court of exchequer”;
“house of lords,” &#38;c. The Catalogue of the Advocates library,
lately printed, is a good example; refer for instance to the
title under Bullion, vol I., 1867, p. 763, a title that in ordinary
catalogues would bristle with capitals.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c009'>The punctuation should also be carefully considered.
Everything in bibliography is at present very much over
punctuated, half, if not two thirds, might be dispensed with
to the lessening of the expense, and the great advantage
in the appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Imagine you are copying a sentence instead of a title page,
and punctuate and put capitals accordingly. If writing that
a work was by an author, nobody would write By, neither
need it have a capital for a copy of a title.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Henry Stevens has advocated and adopted this
method in his later catalogues and notably in the:—“Bibliotheca
geographica and historica or a catalogue of a

<p class='c010'>The title, which I have abbreviated nearly one third, has
upwards of two hundred words in it without a single mark
of punctuation, except after “Part I.” where it seems to have
got in by accident. Throughout his titles, he uses stops
very sparingly. Any word which is complete requires no
stop. Thus: “vols” requires no stop after it, because it is
a finished abbreviation, but vol. does<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE BEGINNING AND THE END.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>The unwise seem to be of opinion that any fool can index,
but we have already seen that the wise think differently.—Wheatley’s
What is an index? 1879, p. 41.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beginning of every book should be a table of contents,
or an analytical table, or both, and the end a good index.</p>

<p class='c010'>I can scarcely over estimate the importance which I
attach to the index. A book may almost as well be unwritten,
as be without an index.</p>

<p class='c010'>The publications by “a lady,” are exceedingly deficient
in indexes. It is amazing that authors who must have felt
the want of indexes in the works of others should publish
their own without such helps.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would occupy too much space to give all the opinions
I have collected of different authors entreating others never
to publish a book without an index. Allibone never loses
an opportunity, in his Dictionary of English Literature, of
impressing upon his readers the importance of indexes. See
more particularly an article of absorbing interest under the
name of Samuel Ayscough of the British Museum, celebrated
for his most useful indexes to Shakespeare, to that grand storehouse
of information “The Gentleman’s Magazine” (obit.
1868), to “the Monthly Review,” and other works. Of such
importance indeed does Allibone consider indexes, that, not
content with insisting on them throughout his three ponderous
volumes, he, on the very last page, gives a note “Concerning
Indexes.” Often a good index obtains for a book a
prominent position it might not otherwise obtain; as, for
example, Godfrey Higgins’s “Anacalypsis,” which is said to
be in the reading room of the British Museum, from its containing<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“thousands of statements cited from all quarters,
and very well indexed.” What would Watt’s Bibliotheca
Britannica be without its two volumes of index to two volumes
of authors. Bibliographical and biographical works beyond
everything require the most minute indexes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Formerly I was in love with the scientific look of a number
of indexes, but I am now convinced that two heads are
not better than one in this case and that one index is more
useful than two. A person who consults an index wants to
find something as quickly as possible, if there is only one
index he cannot consult the wrong one first.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been suggested by Prof. De Morgan that historians
by having no indexes, think to oblige their readers to go
through their works from beginning to end. The contrary
being the result.</p>

<p class='c010'>If book buyers made a rule of not buying a book without
an index, authors and publishers would then supply that
want.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beware, however, of snares, for such there are in this as
in all else, big books with lean, <a id='tn-lanky'></a>lanky, and starved indexes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the above was written the “Index Society” has
come into existence, and published an indispensable little
work, entirely devoted to this subject entitled: What is an
index? a few notes on indexes and indexers by Henry B.

useful this is a most amusing book.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>OF ERRORS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>What still remains to be taken notice of are the <em>errata’s</em>,…
Sometimes they are put by themselves on the even side of
a leaf, so as to face the title. But though this is very
seldom done, it is a pity that it should ever have come into
the thoughts of anyone to do it at all; for it is a maxim
to bring errata’s into as narrow a compass as we conveniently
can, and to put them in a place where they
can make no great show: since it is not to the credit
of a book, to find a catalogue of its faults annexed. It
is therefore wrong policy in those who make errata’s
appear numerous and parading, in hopes of being thought
very careful and accurate; when they only serve to witness
an author’s inattention at a time when he should have
been of the opposite inclination. But the subterfuges
that are used by writers upon this occasion, are commonly
levelled at the printer, to make him the author
of all that is amiss; whereas they ought to ascribe it to
themselves: … whoever has any ideas of printing, must consequently
know that it is impossible to practice that art
without committing errors; and that it is the province
of an author to rectify them. For these several reasons
it will appear how material it is not to make an erratum
of every trifling fault.…—John Smith’s Printer’s
grammar, 1755, quoted in Timperley’s Printer’s Manual,
1838, p. 19.</p>
<p class='c017'>Le nouvel <em>Errata</em>, je le répète, est long, d’une longueur
inaccoutumée. Les auteurs semblent avoir honte d’avouer
les fautes qu’ils ont commises, ou qu’on commet pour
eux; je n’ai pas cette pudeur menteuse; je confesse les
fautes de mon livre.—<span class='sc'>A. Jal</span>: préface de la seconde édition
du Dict. Crit. de Biographie et d’histoire, 1872.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is next to impossible to avoid errors, more especially in
bibliographical works, with numbers of names and figures.
All that can be done to avoid them, of course, should be;
but with the most minute and constant supervision errors
will creep in and oversights occur.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>This, however, is no reason for adopting eccentricities.
For example, Professor De Morgan in his “Arithmetical
Books,” adopted the singular plan of giving the dates twice,
in figures and in words, the latter being abbreviated, and
after all, as he himself shows, he was still liable to commit
the very errors he desired to provide against.</p>

<p class='c010'>His plan never has been, and I hope, never will be adopted
by any one else. It is original, but highly inconvenient and
unbibliographical in the extreme. It is to be hoped that if
a new edition is ever published we shall have proper title
page information in a proper manner, and be spared such
eccentricities as beginning the title-page from the bottom
instead of the top.</p>

<p class='c010'>I may here remark that the learned Professor went upon
the right principle, he excluded no book on the ground of
unimportance, or worthlessness. He described no book
unless he had seen it, which was also J. R. McCulloch’s
plan in his “Literature of Political Economy” (1845), but
he unfortunately described only select works, without even
giving a brief list of what he considered rubbish, simply saying,
“We have proceeded on a principle of selection; and
neglecting the others, have, with exceptions, noticed those
works only which appear to have contributed to develop
sound principles, or to facilitate their adoption.” The consequence
is if we find a book unmentioned by him, it at once
becomes a question whether he excluded it because it was
worthless, or because he had not seen it.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a large class of errors arising from the habit of
one writer copying another, instead of each going to original
sources.</p>

<p class='c010'>The errors prevalent in biography and bibliography were
pointed out by Mr. Bolton Corney years ago. I think it is
unnecessary for me to give here any further criticisms on
the method which should be pursued. The student who
wishes to go deeper into the subject can refer to Bolton
Corney’s pamphlet: “On the New General Biographical
Dictionary,” already noticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work I have quoted above by M. Jal is a large volume
consisting almost entirely of articles in correction of those
existing in other works.</p>

<p class='c010'>No statement of any former writer should be taken for
granted, if there is any more original source. Compilers of
Dictionaries sin greatly in this respect. The reason is probably
that to be correct requires so much time and research
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that it does not pay to be accurate if much time is consumed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The safest way to avoid errors would be to compare the
proof of every title page with the book itself, but the labour
would be enormous, and I doubt if it is practicable in most
cases. Nevertheless, it is the surest way. At the same time
I would not discourage anybody from attempting a catalogue
or bibliotheca, although nobody can expect to do anything
of much value without accuracy, the greater the accuracy
the greater the value.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing is satisfactory but actual inspection of the books
themselves. We have quite enough of descriptions of books
at second, third, or fourth hand, in nearly all existing works,
and it is time now to go upon “a new and improved principle.”
Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt in the preface to his “Collections
and Notes,” 1876, has some interesting remarks on
this subject to which the student can refer.</p>

<p class='c009'>It constantly happens that “a lady,” in one of her later

will be ascertained if it is anonymous. Works are also
advertised at the end of others, either as published, or forthcoming,

these. Indeed, it frequently happens that the works required

Museum.</p>

<p class='c010'>To take the following as an example, in Mrs. H. Mozley’s:
Louisa, or the bride, by the author of the fairy bower
[motto]. London, James Burns, Portman street, and Henry
Mozley &#38; sons, Derby, 1842, 12o, pp. 302.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is pseudonymous. We find advertised at the end by
the same author: Bessie Gray, or the dull child. Hymns
for children on the Lord’s Prayer, our duty to God and scripture
history. Robert Marshall, or the cleverest boy in the
school. The Stanley Ghost. The old Bridge. Some published,
others in the press, none of them, however, have I
(1872), been able to find in the Catalogue of the Library of
the British Museum<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a>. They may be there nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c010'>As another example, I have traced the following works
to the same author, without, however, ascertaining the
author’s name.</p>

<p class='c010'>Spain yesterday and to-day, by a lady, London, Harvey
and Darton [1829?], sm. 8o.—Portugal, or the young travellers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>… 1830.—The new estate, or the young travellers in
Wales and Ireland, by the author of Portugal, … 1831.—The
East Indians at Selwood, or the orphans’ home, by the
author of Portugal; the new estate, &#38;c., &#38;c., Lond. Darton
and Harvey, 1834, small 12o.—Gleanings from many fields,
by the author of Portugal, the new estate, &#38;c., &#38;c., Lond.,
Darton and Harvey, 1834, 12o.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes it is possible to make a tolerably certain guess
at the author, from the similarity in style, or some trick of
the author, as in the punctuation, or the use of italics, as by
Archbishop Whately, or the constant use of the dash, as in
the works of James Flamank.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in all cases corroborative evidence is necessary. For
how wrong a guess of this kind may be has been amply illustrated
in Notes and Queries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every celebrated man has had numerous publications attributed
to him by people who professed themselves quite
certain of the authorship, from the style and subject matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is at present no book which will give any help in
an investigation like the present. In the “Handbook of
Fictitious Names,” at pages 7 and 8, only seven real names
of ladies are revealed, with a note to the effect that there
were upwards of fifty works unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very useful series of catalogues published by Messrs.
Bent, Hodgson, and Sampson Low, the English Catalogue of
the latter being the best of the kind, afford great assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The London catalogue of books, 1814-1851, has a classified
index, and in this anonymous works are frequently attributed
to their real authors, though without any indication
of their anonymity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The British catalogue also has a subject index.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following include the majority of publications from
1800 to the present time, except pamphlets and privately
printed works.</p>

<p class='c010'>The London catalogue of books … since the year 1800 to
March 1827, Lond. pub. for the executor of the late W.
Bent by Longman &#38;c. 1827, 8o.</p>

<p class='c010'>The London catalogue … 1814 to 1846.</p>

<p class='c010'>The London catalogue … 1816 to 1851, Lond., Thomas
Hodgson 13 Paternoster row and sold by Longman &#38;c.,
1851, 8o.</p>

<p class='c010'>The classified index to the London catalogue … 1816 to
1851, London T. Hodgson 1853, 8o.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The British catalogue of books published from oct. 1837,
to dec. 1852 … by Sampson Low, vol. 1. general alphabet,
Lond. S. Low &#38; son, 1853.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this the dates of publication were added for the first
time. The author published an Index to the above in 1858,
in which he acknowledges the assistance of Dr. Crestadoro.</p>

<p class='c010'>The English catalogue of books, published from january,
1835, to january, 1863, comprising the contents of the
“London” and the “British” catalogues, and the principal
works published in the United States of America and Continental
Europe … compiled by Sampson Low [and assistants],
London, S. Low Son &#38; Marston, 1864, r. 8o. And
continuations to the present time. So that we thus have
names of authors and index of subjects from 1814 to the
present time. For the years from 1800 to 1814, Watt’s
Bibliotheca Britannica can be referred to.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will now give an illustration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Information we will say, for example, is sent to the following
effect:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir,—Seeing that you are collecting, with a view to publication,
names of authors of the nineteenth century, I beg
to say that I was well acquainted with Miss Seaman, who
died about the year 1830, a notice of whom you will find in
the Ryde papers. She wrote ‘Some Observations on Girl’s
Schools and Boarding Schools,’ but whether with her name
or not I forget. Also, about 1822, was published, by Smith
of London, an interesting religious tale called Lily, and in
16o, 1825, a capital little work on the choice of books,
with advice about Miss Edgeworth’s Novels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be evident to anyone that the whole of the above
requires verification, a labour of hours, perhaps days, which
might have been saved by a little bibliographical knowledge
on the part of our informant.</p>

<p class='c010'>On investigation it appears, then, that our informant has
scarcely given a single date or title correctly.—1. Miss Seaman
died in 1829, not 1830.—2. The reference to the Ryde
papers is useless, as too wide for verification, and inaccessible.—3.
The title of each of her works is given from recollection,
or rather, from no recollection, and they are all incorrect.—4.
The titles are made up.—5. Words not in the title-pages
are interpolated without notice.—6. The size of the
book is placed before the date—<abbr title='spell'><span lang="fr"><i>i.e.</i></span></abbr> it is interpolated, and in
fact everything is reversed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The above information might be best put in this form.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Seaman</span> (Lucy) the daughter of a Captain in the Royal
Navy, born at Ryde, the 23 May, 1801, wrote several works
which are held in high estimation, and died of consumption
on the 15 September, 1829. The following are the only
publications I know of from her pen; but as she published
without giving her name, there are probably others that are
unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='tn-remarks'></a>(1.) Remarks on education, as at present conducted, especially
with reference to private tuition and the system of
boarding schools for young ladies, London (printed at Ryde),
for the author, 1822, 12mo, pp. iv. 33, anon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The authoress says, that her father’s early death making
her, while very young, acquainted with the routine of teaching,
was the cause of her publishing these remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2.) Little Lily, a moral tale for children, by a lady,
author of Remarks, &#38;c., Lond. J. Smith, 1823, 8o, pp. 115,
2s 6d, pseudon.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the first edition of this excellent little book, the
second and subsequent editions of which were published with
her name.</p>

<p class='c010'>We observe that a book entitled “Little Lily’s travels,
Lond. Nelson, 1860,” has been published; but it is a different
work to the above.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3.) Miss Maria Edgeworth’s tales compared with other
works of fiction; to which is added advice for the selection,
and a list of works most suitable for children, by the author
of Little Lily, &#38;c., Lond., J. Smith, 1826 [1825], 18o, pp.
xi and 200, 3s, auton.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this she complains of her failing health, and expresses
her great respect for the writings of her friend Miss Edgeworth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here it will be observed that the first work is strictly
anonymous, as the abbreviation “anon,” indicates, that is
to say, it has no name on the title-page, nor any name, pseudonym,
nor initials to the preface; and has in fact no clue
whatever as to who is the author, as the reference to her in
the imprint cannot be considered such. But from the book
being printed at Ryde for the author, though published in
London, it may be inferred that she resided at Ryde at the
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second work is pseudonymous, as the abbreviation
“pseudon,” indicates.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third work would appear also by the title-page to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>pseudonymous, it is not so, as the preface is signed by the
authoress, and the abbreviation “auton,” warns us that it is
autonymous.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, I hope that my observations will not dishearten
the student who is ambitious of being bibliographical.
Let every one strive to do his best. But let no man
suppose he can make a good catalogue simply from his desire
to do so and without previous study. It is no use saying
a man must be accurate, he cannot until he has studied
the art of bibliography, and learned what has already been
done in that science; so that by taking note of the errors of
his predecessors, he may attempt a catalogue on the most
modern and improved principles, and thereby contribute towards
the advancement and improvement of bibliography.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LIST OF WORKS BY A LADY.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006'>

<p class='c013'>“Bibliography is a dry occupation,—a caput mortuum,—it
is a borrowed production, which brings very little grist to
the mill; and so difficult and tedious is the object, of laying
before our eyes all the real or reported copies or editions
of the works enumerated, that almost every line of
our reports may be suspected of falsehood.”—James Atkinson,
Medical Bibliography, 1834, 8o [he stopped with
letter B].</p>
<p class='c017'>It is probable that every great national library contains more
works without authors’ names than with them. Of these
anonymous books, a considerable proportion will, doubtless,
belong to authors whose names are either known to,
or conjectured, more or less plausibly, by the learned bibliographer.
But if conjecture be allowed to govern the
<em>place</em> of a book in a catalogue, all reliability on it ceases.—Edward
Edwards, in the Encyclopædia Britannica,
eighth edition, 1857, Art. Libraries, p. 378.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. An account of the celebration of the jubilee, on the 25th
oct. 1809, being the 49th anniversary of the reign of Geo. <span class='fss'>III.</span> …
collected and published by a lady. Birmingham [1809], 4o.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>
I should observe that I have not, out of regard to space, put in the
pagination, price, &#38;c., and that nearly all the places of publication
are abbreviated. I have seen every book which I here describe,
mostly in the Library of the British Museum.
</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>2. Ailzie Grierson … by a lady. Edin. Johnstone 1846, 16o.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Almeda, or the Neapolitan revenge, a tragic drama, by a
lady. Lond. Symonds 1801, 8o.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>
This is in five acts and in verse. The advertisement states that part of
the plot, which relates to the revenge of the Countess (Almeda) was
taken from the “Life of Rozelli.”—The author’s name was not known
to the editors of the Biographia Dramatica 1812.
</span></p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>
In the preface, dated from “Clapham road place,” the authoress says
she has had long experience. This little work is not mentioned by
De Morgan in his list of Arithmetical books.
</span></p>

and new Testaments … selected by a lady [motto] Lond. J. F.
Shaw 1857.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>
I need scarcely say that this has nothing in common with “<em>The</em> Boys’
Own Book,” as to which I had a note in “Notes &#38; Queries” of 27
April, 1878, p. 329. See <a href='#list71'>no. 71</a>.

France and Germany in the same series are written by A. M. S., and
are attributed, with a query, at the British Museum, to Agnes M.
Stewart.

real anecdotes, by a lady, author of Infant’s friend—Easy rhymes,
&#38;c. [motto] 3rd edition. Lond. J. Harris, St. Pauls’ churchyard
[1820?] 12o, pp. 175.</p>

<div class='small'>

“A slight and tentative, though useful production, is the only work

I could quote numerous other notices. Articles have also been written
since this work was published on the subject, mostly acknowledging
the source of their information.
</span></p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<p class='c010'><span class='small'>
I have now determined to limit my collections on this subject, with the
end of the year 1879. I have been so many years engaged in obtaining
materials that I think there will be more chance of publishing if I
confine myself to revising and correcting what I have already collected.
I make this declaration so that any body else who may be inclined
may take up the subject where I leave off, as the presumption
that I am collecting might deter others from doing so.
